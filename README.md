#  Railway Reservation System

A **real-time railway booking system** that allows users to:
-  Authenticate via JWT-based login   
-  Add trains between stations (Admin Only)
-  Search for trains between stations  
-  Check available seats  
-  Book seats with **concurrency safety**  
-  Get booking details
 

The system **prevents double bookings** by ensuring only one user can book a seat when multiple users try **simultaneously**.

Admin API endpoints are protected with an **API key** that will be known only to the admin so that no one can add false data to the system.
